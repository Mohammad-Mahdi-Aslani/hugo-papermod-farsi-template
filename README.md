# hugo-papermod-farsi-template

To use this template Just change the url and then go to Settings > Pages > Build and Deployment > Source > Github Action. 

Also, remember to enable github actions from actions tab. 

For now, Hugo has some problems with Github Actions. You should set your base url like this:
`<your-username>.github.io` not `<you-username>github.io/repo_path`. 

You should also name your repository with `<your-username>.github.io`.

If you want to use this with netlify. You do not need any configuration. Just remember to set publishdir to `public`.
